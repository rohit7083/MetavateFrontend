                Key Advantages to Training:
              </h2>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                <li>
                  <strong>Improved Communication:</strong> Training helps
                  establish clear communication between you and your pet, so
                  they understand what is expected of them & can follow commands
                  effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Better Behaviour:</strong> Trained pets tend to behave
                  better, are more accustomed to responding to commands which
                  helps minimize unwanted negative behaviours.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Stronger Bond:</strong> Training sessions provide
                  quality time to bond with your pet. Positive reinforcement
                  techniques, like treats & praise, build trust & strengthen the
                  relationship.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Safety:</strong> Basic commands like ‚Äúsit‚Äù, ‚Äústay‚Äù, or
                  ‚Äúcome‚Äù can be lifesaving in situations where you need to keep
                  your pet safe.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mental Stimulation:</strong> Training challenges the
                  brain & provides a mental workout. Prevents boredom &
                  destructive behaviour, essentials for high-energy or
                  intelligent breeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Socialization:</strong> Training exposes your pet to
                  different environments, people & other animals, essential to
                  social development. Well socialized animals are less likely to
                  develop fear-based behaviour.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Confidence:</strong> Well-trained pets know what to
                  expect & tend to feel more secure and confident in their
                  surroundings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Good Manners:</strong> A well-trained pet is generally
                  more polite & respectful with both people & other animals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prevention of Behavioral Issues:</strong> Teaching
                  your pet boundaries early on can prevent certain behavioural
                  issues from arising or escalating.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Fun & Enjoyable:</strong> Training can be an enjoyable
                  activity for all involved, it‚Äôs a great way to engage & have
                  fun.
