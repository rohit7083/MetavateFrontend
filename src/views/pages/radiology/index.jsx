                Digital images, including ultrasounds, radiographs, MRIs, and CT
                scans are used to diagnose a variety of conditions and ailments
                in dogs and cats. Common conditions diagnosed include broken
                bones, joint problems, tumors, brain abnormalities, and problems
                with the internal organs, including the heart, lungs, liver,
                kidneys, and bladder.

                Ultrasound imaging involves using sound waves to create an image
                on a computer monitor. When our team passes the wand over an
                injured area of your pet, we are able to find otherwise hidden
                problems, like when your pet accidentally eats something that
                isn't food, has a tumor, or has problems with an internal organ,
                like the stomach, spleen, liver, and pancreas. Ultrasound
                imaging is completely painless and does not have any side
                effects.

                bone abnormalities. X-rays can also be used to diagnose problems
                with the internal organs, like the heart, lungs, spleen, liver,
                and kidneys.

                MRI is an acronym for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. This type of
                diagnostic equipment has the ability to produce detailed images
                of the internal structures of the body. They are helpful in
                diagnosing tumors and abnormalities in the brain as well as
                spinal disorders, like herniated discs and spinal stenosis in
                cats and dogs.
