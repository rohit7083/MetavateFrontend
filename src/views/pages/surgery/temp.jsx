              Advanced Monitoring During Surgery
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Veterinary surgery often requires multiple professionals working
              together. While your pet is in the surgical room, our team
              constantly monitors and adjusts your pet's temperature, IV fluids,
              and anesthesia. We communicate any potential anomalies that could
              affect the surgeryâ€™s outcome to ensure a safe and successful
              procedure.

              your pet. Our staff is fully dedicated to making sure your pet
