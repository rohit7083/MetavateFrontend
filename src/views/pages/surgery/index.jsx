                Veterinary surgery often requires multiple professionals working
                together. While your pet is in the surgical room, our team
                constantly monitors and adjusts your pet's temperature, IV
                fluids, and anesthesia. We communicate any potential anomalies
                that could affect the surgeryâ€™s outcome to ensure a safe and
                successful procedure.
